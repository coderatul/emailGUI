# 📋 Unexpected things
- while keeping mail count as default i.e, sending 1 mail subject is sent as it is.

- But while sending multiple mails a random number is appended with the subject, because if we keep the subject same then receiver won't get seperate mails instead he'd be getting grouped mails.
